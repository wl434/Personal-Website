## Introduction:


Currently In Progress...

This project looked at monthly returns for different industries and fixed income instruments from 1930 to 2021 and looked to adjust the traditional Markowitz rebalancing model in order to limit the appearance of large drawdowns in the total portfolio value. To analyze results, we compare the monthly returns, standard deviation of the returns, and the skew of the distribution of monthly returns for both a traditional Markowitz model and our adjusted Drawdown model.


From our initial analysis, using our adjusted Drawdown model for portfolio rebalancing allowed us to greatly limit large negative monthly returns while maintaining overall returns relatively close to that of the Markowitz model. While returns decreased by ~20%, the standard deviation of returns decreased by ~40%. We recommend this model be used when looking at portfolios such as a retirement portfolio. When making investment decisions for a retirement account, the most important risk to consider is the exposure to large drawdowns, particularly after an individuals retirement. By using this model, a retiree can rest assured that their investments are protected from large drawdowns based on their personal risk tolerance.
