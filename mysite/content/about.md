## Bio:
#### Undergrad:
I studied Economics, Engineering, and Statistics at Swarthmore College. While at Swarthmore,
I also played baseball for four years, during which we won the Centennial Conference Championship and
made a NCAA Division III World Series appearance, culminating in a top 3 national ranking.

#### Full Time Work:
After Swarthmore, I spent one year as a client facing consultant at Veeva Systems, where I worked with clients to asses business needs, design solutions, and ensure delivery of these tailored solutions. This work required time in configuration, data migration, and system validation.

#### Graduate:
I am now Masters of Financial Engineering student at Cornell University. I have taken courses such as Learning with Big Messy Data, Statistics for Financial Engineering, Optimization, Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering, Investment and Portfolio Management, etc. My Project work has consisted of: Applying Machine Learning Methods to create a more accurate CDS pricing model, using an ensemble, Hidden Markov + XGBoost model to predict the overall market "state" (bull, bear, or neutral), and adjusting the Markowitz model for portfolio optimization to avoid large drawdowns in the portfolio value.
