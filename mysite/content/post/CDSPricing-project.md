## Introduction:
A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is an instrument that has become fundamental to the US financial markets ever since the global economic crisis of 2008. The owner of a CDS has protection against the default of a debtor, akin to owning a put option on the assets of a company or sovereign. The purpose of owning a CDS on a US company is self evident, however, it is difficult to transact in the US Corporate CDS because the market is, in many ways, inefficient. In contrast to the more liquid US Equities market, CDS are not exchange-traded, have far fewer participants, higher regulatory barriers to entry, and are relatively newer.

Moreover, CDS pricing models are far less developed. In this paper we attempt to build a stronger pricing model for US High Yield Corporate 5-year CDS, by organically learning the probability of default and by allowing the Recovery rate for these bonds to vary across time and across companies. Having a stronger pricing model can help investors to better identify and act on mispricings, adding more confidence to the CDS market. As more participants enter the market and adopt a stronger pricing methodology, the market will become more efficient. The positive feedback loop will benefit investors, market-makers, and risk managers alike.
